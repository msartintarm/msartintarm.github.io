##  CS 559 Spring 2013: Project #2

**Title:** Caged

**Authors:** Michael Vello Sartin-Tarm, Christopher Richard Aberger

**Project Description:**  A webgl implementation of our IKEA DAFRED stool in 
 our special version of an environment.  Our environment is not the 
 typical environment per-se; we make you earn the right to view our
 stool by completing a maze.  At each dead end in the maze you will
 see rotating objects (that we used to build the stool).  Finally
 when you complete the maze, the heaven wall piece (you start out in
 hell) you enter God mode where you have complete mobility.  You
 also should notice our stools in a unique environment.  While 
 moving through the maze you carry a light, whose position can 
 be adjusted through use of the mouse.

**Features:** The project features the use of texturing, mesh-built objects, 
     phong and flat shading, debug windows, and custom built shaders.
         The code in this project was created from scratch by us.

**Movement:**  To move through the maze use the up, down, left, right, keys in
                         order to move forward, backwards, left, and right respectively.
    	     	                The 'a' and 'd' keys will cause the camera to look left and 
						    	            right respectively.  Once you complete the maze you get GOD 

**Movement (God Mode):**
        mode enabling extra mobility.  Specifically 'i' and 'j' will
	         allow the user to look 'up' and 'down' respectively.  The keys
		               'w' and 's' will allow the user to move up and down.
